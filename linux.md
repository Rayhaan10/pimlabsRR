# Linux

## Introduction
Linux is an **open source computer operating system,** initially developed on and for Intel x86-based personal computers. It has been subsequently ported to an astoundingly long list of other hardware platforms, from tiny embedded appliances to the world's largest supercomputers.

## History of Linux
**Linus Torvalds** was a student in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991, when he started a project: writing his own operating system kernel. He also collected together and/or developed the other essential ingredients required to construct an entire operating system with his kernel at the center. It wasn't long before this became known as the **Linux kernel.**

 By combining the kernel with other system components from the GNU project, numerous other developers created complete systems called **Linux distributions** in the mid-90’s.

 The **Linux distributions** created in the **mid-90s** provided the basis for fully free (in the sense of freedom, not zero cost) computing and became a driving force in the **open source software movement.** In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced their support for the Linux platform and began major development efforts as well.

 Today, Linux powers more than half of the servers on the Internet, the majority of smartphones (via the Android system, which is built on top of Linux), and all of the **world’s most powerful supercomputers.**
