**Bash**
Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’.

**Shell**
Shell is a macro processor which allows for an interactive or non-interactive command execution.

**Scripting**
Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed interactively one-by-one.
