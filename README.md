## Bash Shell Scripting
### Introduction

**Bash**
Bash is a command language interpreter. It is widely available on various operating systems and is a default command interpreter on most GNU/Linux systems. The name is an acronym for the ‘Bourne-Again SHell’.

**Shell**
Shell is a macro processor which allows for an interactive or non-interactive command execution.

**Scripting**
Scripting allows for an automatic commands execution that would otherwise be executed interactively one-by-one.

## Linux
#### Introduction
Linux is an **open source computer operating system,** initially developed on and for Intel x86-based personal computers. It has been subsequently ported to an astoundingly long list of other hardware platforms, from tiny embedded appliances to the world's largest supercomputers.

### History of Linux
**Linus Torvalds** was a student in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991, when he started a project: writing his own operating system kernel. He also collected together and/or developed the other essential ingredients required to construct an entire operating system with his kernel at the center. It wasn't long before this became known as the **Linux kernel.**

 By combining the kernel with other system components from the GNU project, numerous other developers created complete systems called **Linux distributions** in the mid-90’s.

 The **Linux distributions** created in the **mid-90s** provided the basis for fully free (in the sense of freedom, not zero cost) computing and became a driving force in the **open source software movement.** In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced their support for the Linux platform and began major development efforts as well.

 Today, Linux powers more than half of the servers on the Internet, the majority of smartphones (via the Android system, which is built on top of Linux), and all of the **world’s most powerful supercomputers.**

## AWS
### Introduction
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive, evolving **cloud computing platform** provided by Amazon that includes a mixture of **infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS) offerings.** AWS services can offer an organization tools such as **compute power, database storage and content delivery services.**

AWS launched in **2006** from the internal infrastructure that Amazon.com built to handle its online retail operations. AWS was one of the first companies to introduce a **pay-as-you-go cloud computing model that scales to provide users with compute, storage or throughput as needed.**

#### Brief Overview of the Services provided by AWS

More than **100 services** comprise the Amazon Web Services portfolio. These services, by category, include:

- Compute
- Storage databases
- Data management
- Migration
- Hybrid Cloud
- Networking
- Development tools
- Management
- Monitoring
- Security
- Governance
- Big data management
- Analytics
- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Mobile development
- Messages and notification

## GCP
### Introduction

Google Cloud Platform is essentially a **public cloud-based machine** whose services are delivered to customers on a **pay-as-you-go basis,** by way of service components.
A public cloud lets you leverage its resources to empower the applications you build, as well as to reach a broader base of customers.

#### Key Benefits
Google  Cloud’s security model provides **end-to-end process to clients’ data and application.**\
Google’s big data technology innovations provide innovative  services such as  
**BigQuery** for Data warehousing,\
**AI Platform** for advanced machine learning,
**Dataflow ,Pub/Sub, DataProc** for batch and real-time data processing,\
**Dataprep** for intelligent data preparation and Data studio provides powerful data insights.\
**Cloud big data analytics** solutions are serverless, removing the complexity of building and maintaining a data analytics system.\
**A Global Networking and edge caching** services to deliver fast, consistent, and scalable performance.
**Google Cloud data centers** run on half the energy of a typical data center, and run on 100% renewable energy where available.

## Git
### Introduction
#### What is Git?
Git is a **free, open-source version control software.** It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.

This basically means that Git is a **content tracker.** So Git can be used to store content — and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.

#### How Git Works
Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a **version control system like Git** to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.Also, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and **go back to an older version of their code.**


#### Git hosting services
There are three popular Git hosting services:

GitHub (owned by Microsoft), \
GitLab (owned by GitLab) and\
BitBucket.

##### Git Repositories
If we want to start using Git, we need to know where to host our repositories.

A repository (or “Repo” for short) is a **project that contains multiple files.** In our case a repository will contain code-based files.

##### Instal Git
1. Verify that Git is installed correctly by running the following command on the terminal

git --version

2. Run the following commands with your information to set a default username and email when you’re going to save your work.

git config --global user.name "MV Thanoshan"
git config --global user.email "example@mail.com"
