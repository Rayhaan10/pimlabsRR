# Git

## Introduction

### What is Git?
Git is a **free, open-source version control software.** It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. This tool is a version control system that was initially developed to work with several developers on the Linux kernel.

This basically means that Git is a **content tracker.** So Git can be used to store content — and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.

### How Git Works
Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a **version control system like Git** to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.Also, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and **go back to an older version of their code.**


### Git hosting services
There are three popular Git hosting services:
- GitHub (owned by Microsoft)
- GitLab (owned by GitLab)
- BitBucket.

### Git Repositories
If we want to start using Git, we need to know where to host our repositories.

A repository (or “Repo” for short) is a **project that contains multiple files.** In our case a repository will contain code-based files.

### Configure Git
Run the following commands with your information to set a default username and email when you’re going to save your work.

```
git config --global user.name "MV Thanoshan"
git config --global user.email "example@mail.com"
```
